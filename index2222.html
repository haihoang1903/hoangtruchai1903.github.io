										</p><p><strong>Student number</strong>: 3818558
										</p><p><strong>Email</strong>: s3818558@rmit.edu.vn
										</p><p><strong>Background Information</strong>: I'm Vietnamese and my hometown is in Nam Dinh province which is located in the Northern of Vietnam. My date of birth is 19/03/2001 so this is my first year in University. There are 4 people in my family: my father, my mother, my sister and me. I also have a Japanese-German dog and his name is Lu. He's about 3 years old and he's very goofy and stubborn but I always love him. About my hobbies, I defined myself as a sporty person. In my free time, I usually playing basketball or football with my friends and I feel joyful playing with them. I used to be a very shy child and playing these sports helped me to speak with more people and open up to them. I also take pleasure in listening to music. Jazz and Classical help me recharge and bring me joy after stressful time of studying. Therefore, I listen to music every morning before I go to school and after finished my homework.   </p>

										<h2 class="colorlib-heading">What is my interest in IT?</h2>
										<p><strong>Hi I'm Hoàng Trúc Hải</strong> On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country.</p>
										<p>Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.</p>
										<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
										<p>There are 3 reasons why I chose to study in RMIT. The main first reason is because I want to live and work in Australia with my relatives in the future. Secondly, RMIT is a global university recognized for leadership and innovation in technology, design and enterprise. Therefore, studying in RMIT can give me best experience along with the IT skills to succeed in my career path. Finally, I can learn from IT experts working at the forefront of their fields and benefit from lecturers in RMIT. </p>
										<h2 class="colorlib-heading">What do I expect to learn during my studies?</h2>
										<p>Most people believe university is a big jump from high school, and for many it is an overwhelming change. For me, the first thing I expect when I study in university is adapting to the university culture so I can study more effectively. Moreover, I want to get more responsible for my study by doing projects and assignments so it will help me to prepare for professional working environment in the future. In addition, studying in RMIT is one of the best ways to develop my skills and meet new people from different culture. By working with them, I can gain new experiences that I may not otherwise have considered. It’s a great opportunity to explore and discover myself, developing both personally and professionally. About the IT program, I expect to gain all the necessary knowledge of programming to fulfill the requirements of IT jobs that every company need and I hope lecturers can help me to prolong my inspiration in this program. </p>
