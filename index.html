										<p><strong>Email</strong>: s3818558@rmit.edu.vn
										<p><strong>Background Information</strong>: I'm Vietnamese and my hometown is in Nam Dinh province which is located in the Northern of Vietnam. My date of birth is 19/03/2001 so this is my first year in University. There are 4 people in my family: my father, my mother, my sister and me. I also have a Japanese-German dog and his name is Lu. He's about 3 years old and he's very goofy and stubborn but I always love him. About my hobbies, I defined myself as a sporty person. In my free time, I usually playing basketball or football with my friends and I feel joyful playing with them. I used to be a very shy child and playing these sports helped me to speak with more people and open up to them. I also take pleasure in listening to music. Jazz and Classical help me recharge and bring me joy after stressful time of studying. Therefore, I listen to music every morning before I go to school and after finished my homework.   </p>

										<h2 class="colorlib-heading">What is my interest in IT?</h2>
										<p>I think coding is my best interest in IT.</p>
										<h2 class="colorlib-heading">When did my interest in IT start?</h2>
										<p>I remember it was in 2007, my father bought me a computer as a birthday present and the first thing that interested me in PCs were computer games. But slowly I discovered the true power of computers and then I went on to learn PASCAL which culminated in an interest in programming. When I first learned Informatics in middle school, I got very high score because I have already known some basic of Pascal and I was happied with it. Luckily, my teacher advised me and my classmates to do some small projects. Therefore, I was enjoying every bit of it.</p>
										<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
										<p>There are 3 reasons why I chose to study in RMIT. The main first reason is because I want to live and work in Australia with my relatives in the future. Secondly, RMIT is a global university recognized for leadership and innovation in technology, design and enterprise. Therefore, studying in RMIT can give me best experience along with the IT skills to succeed in my career path. Finally, I can learn from IT experts working at the forefront of their fields and benefit from lecturers in RMIT. </p>
										<h2 class="colorlib-heading">What do I expect to learn during my studies?</h2>
										<p>Most people believe university is a big jump from high school, and for many it is an overwhelming change. For me, the first thing I expect when I study in university is adapting to the university culture so I can study more effectively. Moreover, I want to get more responsible for my study by doing projects and assignments so it will help me to prepare for professional working environment in the future. In addition, studying in RMIT is one of the best ways to develop my skills and meet new people from different culture. By working with them, I can gain new experiences that I may not otherwise have considered. It’s a great opportunity to explore and discover myself, developing both personally and professionally. About the IT program, I expect to gain all the necessary knowledge of programming to fulfill the requirements of IT jobs that every company need and I hope lecturers can help me to prolong my inspiration in this program. </p>

							<p>Game Designer is a job which people designing characters, levels, puzzles, art and animation by writing code and using various computer programming languages. People work in this position have to review development progress and analyze game performance to ensure the product quality meets the high expectations. Moreover, this job also collaborates with other people who are designers, artists, engineers to make high quality products. About what makes it appeals me, games got me into computers, computers got me into programming. I think that make sense to the reason why I want to create games. Actually, I have played A LOT of games since I was 5 years old and I got interested in how they were made. In every game I played, I always wanted to know the answer of the big question- “How do they do that?”. I loved the way the game, 2D or 3D just held people in this virtual world, and in there, people can do or be whatever they want. By becoming a Game Designer, I knew I could see the answer to that question.</P> 
							<p>Firstly, as a Game Designer people must have some key skills such as creativity, artistic vision, passion for games, sharp eye on detail, self-motivation, self-organization, strong communication skill in both verbal and written and have strong sense of responsibility especially teamwork ability. Moreover, this position also required using problem-solving skills to make their games attract more people. About the qualifications, people who apply for this job need to have a strong understanding of the gameplay experience, technical skills in programming such as C++, Python, C# and UX/UI design also analytics and statistical skill. Job experience in this position offered at least 1 year of experience.</p>
							<p>About my personal skills, I don’t consider myself as a creative person but my parents and my friends believe it by the way I think and how I solving problems through projects and I have an enormous passion for games as I wrote above. I also believe one of my strengths is communication skill because in all my group projects in high school, I’m always a presenter and I’m a person who debate with other groups. Moreover, I usually voted as a team leader because my teammates like the way I manage the team and guide them in their job. However, I don’t have much technical skills in programming to design game. I have only learned some basic of programming languages such as Python, C++, Unity and I don’t have any knowledge of UX/UI design. Therefore, there are lots of things I need to learn more to fulfill their requirements.</p>
							<p>To obtain the skills, the first action that I need to do is study well in IT program in RMIT to gain necessary knowledge, practical experience and importantly is to graduate 😊. In my studies, I will join some extra classes of programming like Unity, C# and UX/UI design so I can reach that company requirements. Moreover, I will join in IT club in RMIT and make friends so I can gain more knowledge and experience from senior students and make group to help each other in assignments. I will add more works in my plan in the future.</p>

							<p>The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.</p>

							<p>Before you start to think about getting other people involved there are several key choices to make:</p>
							<p>What game engine are you going to use, or will you code one from scratch?</p>
							<p>What will attract people to your game?</p>
							<p>Who is your target audience?<p>
							<p>I try to keep things open source, so as a game engine I chose to use Blender's internal game engine. Other free options are Unity, Spring and many others. Have a look at the wikipedia page for game engines.</p>
							<p>You choice of engine may be influenced by things like: </p>
							<p>Programming languages you know<p>
							<p>Licencing of published games<p>
							<p>Game-play type. (ie Spring is for RTS only)</p>

							<p>When you create a game you have to think about who will play it and how they will find out about it. As I found out, making a game is 10% developing and 90% promoting. </p>
							<p>Most game projects have a website, for consumers and developers.</p>
							<p>Publish WIP versions of your game on the web.</p>
							<p>Make posters and distribute them on the web.</p>
							<p>You also have to think about who will play it. What makes it stand out from other computer games? There are millions of FPS's and RTS's, yours must be slightly different to make an impact. But it can't be so radical so as to turn people away.</p>
								Make sure you have an audience. </p>
