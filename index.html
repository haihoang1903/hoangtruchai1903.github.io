										<h2 class="colorlib-heading">What is my interest in IT?</h2>
										<p>I think coding is my best interest in IT.</p>
										<h2 class="colorlib-heading">When did my interest in IT start?</h2>
										<p>I remember it was in 2007, my father bought me a computer as a birthday present and the first thing that interested me in PCs were computer games. But slowly I discovered the true power of computers and then I went on to learn PASCAL which culminated in an interest in programming. When I first learned Informatics in middle school, I got very high score because I have already known some basic of Pascal and I was happied with it. Luckily, my teacher advised me and my classmates to do some small projects. Therefore, I was enjoying every bit of it.</p>
										<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
										<p>There are 3 reasons why I chose to study in RMIT. The main first reason is because I want to live and work in Australia with my relatives in the future. Secondly, RMIT is a global university recognized for leadership and innovation in technology, design and enterprise. Therefore, studying in RMIT can give me best experience along with the IT skills to succeed in my career path. Finally, I can learn from IT experts working at the forefront of their fields and benefit from lecturers in RMIT. </p>
										<h2 class="colorlib-heading">What do I expect to learn during my studies?</h2>
										<p>Most people believe university is a big jump from high school, and for many it is an overwhelming change. For me, the first thing I expect when I study in university is adapting to the university culture so I can study more effectively. Moreover, I want to get more responsible for my study by doing projects and assignments so it will help me to prepare for professional working environment in the future. In addition, studying in RMIT is one of the best ways to develop my skills and meet new people from different culture. By working with them, I can gain new experiences that I may not otherwise have considered. It’s a great opportunity to explore and discover myself, developing both personally and professionally. About the IT program, I expect to gain all the necessary knowledge of programming to fulfill the requirements of IT jobs that every company need and I hope lecturers can help me to prolong my inspiration in this program. </p>

							<p>Game Designer is a job which people designing characters, levels, puzzles, art and animation by writing code and using various computer programming languages. People work in this position have to review development progress and analyze game performance to ensure the product quality meets the high expectations. Moreover, this job also collaborates with other people who are designers, artists, engineers to make high quality products. About what makes it appeals me, games got me into computers, computers got me into programming. I think that make sense to the reason why I want to create games. Actually, I have played A LOT of games since I was 5 years old and I got interested in how they were made. In every game I played, I always wanted to know the answer of the big question- “How do they do that?”. I loved the way the game, 2D or 3D just held people in this virtual world, and in there, people can do or be whatever they want. By becoming a Game Designer, I knew I could see the answer to that question.</P> 
							<p>Firstly, as a Game Designer people must have some key skills such as creativity, artistic vision, passion for games, sharp eye on detail, self-motivation, self-organization, strong communication skill in both verbal and written and have strong sense of responsibility especially teamwork ability. Moreover, this position also required using problem-solving skills to make their games attract more people. About the qualifications, people who apply for this job need to have a strong understanding of the gameplay experience, technical skills in programming such as C++, Python, C# and UX/UI design also analytics and statistical skill. Job experience in this position offered at least 1 year of experience.</p>
							<p>About my personal skills, I don’t consider myself as a creative person but my parents and my friends believe it by the way I think and how I solving problems through projects and I have an enormous passion for games as I wrote above. I also believe one of my strengths is communication skill because in all my group projects in high school, I’m always a presenter and I’m a person who debate with other groups. Moreover, I usually voted as a team leader because my teammates like the way I manage the team and guide them in their job. However, I don’t have much technical skills in programming to design game. I have only learned some basic of programming languages such as Python, C++, Unity and I don’t have any knowledge of UX/UI design. Therefore, there are lots of things I need to learn more to fulfill their requirements.</p>
							<p>To obtain the skills, the first action that I need to do is study well in IT program in RMIT to gain necessary knowledge, practical experience and importantly is to graduate 😊. In my studies, I will join some extra classes of programming like Unity, C# and UX/UI design so I can reach that company requirements. Moreover, I will join in IT club in RMIT and make friends so I can gain more knowledge and experience from senior students and make group to help each other in assignments. I will add more works in my plan in the future.</p>

							<p><b>Overview:</b></p>
							<p>About my project idea, I want to develop an online multiplayer simulation game and I would like to call it Sai Gon Society (SGS). This game will base on two popular games that me and my best friends have played since we were kids – The Sims and GTA Online. The unique of this game is the gameplay designs such as maps, vehicles, streets will all take from Ho Chi Minh City architecture and infrastructure. The basic object of the game is players will create their own characters based on given appearances to the online world and then they can choose different types of job and finish their job’s missions to earn money in order to survive.</p>
							<p><b>Motivation:</b></p>
							<p>First of all, the attractive gameplay of The Sims and GTA Online makes me want to create a game that can combine two styles of these games together and I believe it will be wonderful to bring Vietnamese culture to people all over the world. According to The Metro page of UK, there were more than 33 million active players on GTA Online in 2019. Moreover, according to The Sims’s forum in 2017, The Sims 4 had 200 million monthly players and it will increase up to 35% in the next two years. However, in order to play these games, players must purchase them on Steam or EA and they all pay through credit card so it is quite difficult for students in Vietnam, who are not old enough to create bank account or have lots of money to buy them. Therefore, Sai Gon Society which will be made and hosted in VN can easily approach the local player due to its purchase convenience. Moreover, I believe this game can attract global players because they were too familiar with the gameplay of GTA Online and The Sims and they may want to have new experience on a new gameplay. Through this game, Vietnamese players can connect to each other and create an online community.</p>
							<p><b>Description:</b></p>
							<p>Sai Gon Society is an online multiplayer life simulation game. In the beta version, this game will have only two languages options are Vietnamese and English. If it succeeded in Vietnam market, I will add more language options. To purchase the game, people have to buy through online purchase platforms including credit card or phonecard. The price of this game will be 100.000(vnd) in Vietnam and $4.99 for other countries.</p>
							<p>About the Gameplay:</p>
							<p>- To create a character, there will be 3 steps respectively:</p>
							<p>+ Firstly, players will choose their gender (male, female, neutral).</p>
							<p>+ Secondly, players will design their appearances (face shape, hair style, eyes color, skin color, height, weight, …).</p>
							<p>+ Thirdly, players will select emotions relate to their characteristic (hot-headed, insane, outgoing, romantic, …).</p>
							<p>+ Finally, they will choose their first job (doctor, teacher, singer, police, …).</p>
							<p>Basically, the character creation will partly base on what The Sims did.</p>
							<p>- Besides having casual clothes in daily life, it will have some Vietnamese traditional costumes (Ao dai, Ao ba ba, …), foods (Pho, Mi Quang, Bun bo, …) and vehicles (motorbikes, bicycles, xich lo, …) to make it look more familiar to Vietnamese players and appealed to global players. </p>
							<p>- Streets in SGS will be designed partly same in real life but there will have all 24 districts separate to each other that will be showed clearly in the map.</p>
							<p>- As a simulation game, it is important to have some features that do not exist in the real world, for example score or fantasy, mainly to enhance the learning process. In the first gameplay, all players are in level 1 and they will automatically gain 1 billion (vnd) to build house and accommodations. There will be some locked buy mode items only be unlocked through the progression of career levels. However, they can rent rooms, houses monthly from other players to save their money for business. </p>
							<p>- Players can develop their own stories and purposes with traits and aspirations. For example, players can make relationships between all gender (marriage, divorce), they can purchase some skills like singing, playing guitar, doing sports, …. Therefore, SGS will unleash players imagination and create a unique world of Sai Gon that never happen in real life.</p>
							<p>- Players can explore and customize every detail from SGS to homes, workplaces, working experiences and much more. For example, players can decorate their own houses (walls, bathroom, bedroom, living room, garage, …), try new jobs (taxi driver, officer, doctor, nurse, teacher, …). From that, players can improve their creativity and explore job’s environment which may affect to their real-life future prospects.</p> 
							<p>- Characters can travel between locations over 24 districts, discover amazing and distinctive neighborhoods, and encounter captivating venues. Players can also visit new communities to expand their social experiences, make friends or join unforgettable events. For example, players can go to the bar and have some drinks together or chatting while walking in the park. If there was Tet holiday, shops will have discount and there will be lots of flowers (Apricot blossom, Peach blossom, …). All the fun activities will be added or adjusted to enhance player’s satisfaction.</p>
							<p><b>Tools and Technologies:</b></p>
							<p>Tools to create SGS:</p>
							<p>- Unity 3D because it uses NSIS so that is a good choice.</p>
							<p>- GameMaker Studio 2 to fasten the creating process.</p>
							<p>- Unreal Engine 4 to perfect the animation and make the game look more realistic.</p>
							<p>Technologies to create SGO:</p>
							<p>- Hosting company to charge every GB that gets downloaded.</p>
							<p>- Partner who is a content delivery network provider that specialize in distribution.</p>
							<p>- Some user log-in feature in order to know who it is playing the game.</p>
							<p>- Purchase servers that can deliver the content, and allow gamers to find each other.</p>
							<p><b>Skills Required:</b></p>
							<p>- Develop the code that enables multiplayer gameplay over a network.</p>
							<p>- Fluent in the popular video game development programming languages such as C, C#, C++, Java.</p>
							<p>- Good at 3D modeling, character animation, world design, storyboarding, simulation programming and more.</p>
							<p>- Develop the artificial intelligence (AI) that dictates reactions of computer-controlled elements.</p>
							<p>- Create narrative features, such as story-lines, role-play mechanics and character bios.</p>
							<p>- 2D/3D computer animation software to mockup and animate video game levels and worlds.</p>
							<p>- Collaborate between game programmers and designers to ensure finished product is consistent with original artwork.</p>
							<p><b>Outcome:</b></p>
							<p>If SGS is successful, firstly me and my teammates will gain reputation and love from Vietnam gaming community also the world. Secondly, some game design companies like EA, Rockstar, Gameloft may want to invest money and workers in our game to make it stronger so we will have lots of profits. Moreover, we can solve one of the original problems that is inevitable in this type of game is the lack of developers and designers to create and develop enormous details and animation thanks to the cooperation of these companies. About the impact, I want to made this game in order to help the young generation in VN take inspiration for their own life, flex their creativity skills through the way they build and decorate their houses, and importantly is to help them alleviate stress.</p>
